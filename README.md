# PyLogger

This was a very short Python script I wrote that utilizes the pynput and pyperclip libraries to track key-strokes on a computer. 

The code is short and includes a few comments to explain anything that may be uncertain, I also talk about this in a [youtube video](https://youtu.be/MYFhfpMm7gc).
